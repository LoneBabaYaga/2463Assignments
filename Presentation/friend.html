        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            "Mole Mayhem" is a whack-a-mole style game where players dive into the world of a vibrant garden and are tasked with protecting it from mischievous moles. Players must whack the moles as they pop up from the ground to earn points, but must avoid hitting any friendly creatures to avoid penalties. The game ends if the player misses three moles in a row and gets progressively faster.
