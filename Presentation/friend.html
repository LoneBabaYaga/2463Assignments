        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            "Mole Mayhem" is a whack-a-mole style game where players dive into the world of a vibrant garden and are tasked with protecting it from mischievous moles. Players must whack the moles as they pop up from the ground to earn points, but must avoid hitting any friendly creatures to avoid penalties. The game ends if the player hits 3 friendly creatures. You win by hitting 10 moles.

        <h2>Hardware Input</h2>
        <p>The game has no hardware input except the use of the mouse for the game. There was plans for a joystick, but did not get to it.</p>

        <h2>Hardware Output</h2>
        <p>There is no hardward output, however, it can be implemented for the future. The idea was to have the button turn green when a mole is hit, and turn red when a friendly creature is hit.</p>
